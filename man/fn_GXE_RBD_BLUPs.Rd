\title{Fit a GXE model to extract the best linear unbiased predictors for the genotype values,
assuming a randomised complete block design (RCBD; each block is a complete replication of all genotypes) in multiple environments.
We use this design when we expect heterogeneity along a single direction in each trial area, e.g. field trial along a slope.}

\arguments{
\item{df}{data frame containing the model variables}

\item{trait}{name of the continuous numeric response variable in the data frame}

\item{id}{name of the entry field in the data frame}

\item{env}{name of the environment field in the data frame}

\item{block}{name of the complete or incomplete block field in the data frame}

\item{tolParInv}{diagonal loading of the variance-covariance matrix prior to inversion}

\item{skip_algo_based_on_dimensions}{if there are potentially more effects to be estimated than the number of observations then skip Henderson's fitting in favour of the Newton-Raphson transformations, and vice-versa}

\item{verbose}{show model fitting messages?}
}
\value{
df_effects: data frame trial-estimated breeding values per environment (fields: id, env, BLUPs)
loglik: log-likelihood of the best-fitting model
AIC:  Akaike information criterion (prediction error estimator) of the best-fitting model
BIC: Bayesian information criterion (another prediction error estimator) of the best-fitting model
algorithm: model fitting algorithm used, i.e. Henderson's (mmec) or Newton-Raphson-transformations (mmer)
model: Specification of the best-fitting linear model
V: Variance-covariance component of the random effects
